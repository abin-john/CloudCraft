To handle multiple environment builds in a Vite project, you can create different environment configuration files and use them during the build process. Vite supports environment variables through .env files.

Here's how you can set up multiple environment builds:

Create Environment Files: Create different .env files for each environment in the root of your project. For example:

.env.development
.env.staging
.env.production
Each file should contain the environment-specific variables. For example, .env.development might look like this:

Update vite.config.js: Ensure your vite.config.js file is set up to use the environment variables. Vite automatically loads the appropriate .env file based on the NODE_ENV or MODE environment variable.

Update package.json Scripts: Add scripts to your package.json to build for different environments. For example:

Run the Build Command: Use the appropriate script to build for the desired environment. For example, to build for staging:

Here's an example of how your package.json might look:

By following these steps, you can easily manage multiple environment builds for your Vite project.
